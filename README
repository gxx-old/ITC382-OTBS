I had originally intended to add an admin back end and had done a good bit of work on it when I accidentally deleted the admin namespace. As I didn't have it backed up anywhere, that was it for me for that avenue of work. I have used acts_as_state_machine with restful_authentication to provide user account management. One can create a booking (and pay for it with a credit card, apparently) and can edit or delete it as long as it has at least 15 minutes until it is about to be completed. User authentication is completed through email, (i've left a line uncommented in the User model that allows a freshly created user to be recognised as logged in for the duration of the session for testing purposes). There's a pretty comprehensive list of validations on each model, allow_blank on the non presence validating validations so that empty posts aren't spammed with maximum number of errors. Various rescues including a custom exception are handled in the application controller with rails 2.0's rescue_from command. Other than that and possibly some things I'm forgetting, it's pretty straightforward.
